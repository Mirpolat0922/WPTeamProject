All girls are the same
Ronin
Valentine in December
You said you love me but you don't remember
My name, you cause me pain
All girls are the same

I don't love you now
All girls are the same
I don't need you now
All girls are the same

All of these demons they're dancin' inside
I don't know whether to live or to die (die)
But I keep fighting that feeling inside
I'm gonna ride, gonna ride 'til I die

Sorry my homies I left to the side
Do you ever think of suicide?
Fuck all this pain you can see in my eyes
You fucking around, you gone pay with your life
